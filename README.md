# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
 
 ## Description
 This project looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
 <br>
 ## Problem Defination
<I>Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?</I>
 <br>
 
  ## Conclusion
- We tried and Compare three classifiers i.e,: <B>Logistic Regression,K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier</B> and <B>Random Forest Classifier</B>.
- After experimenting and tunning the hyperparameters using <B>RandomizedSearchCV</B> as well as <B>GridSearchCV</B> and found that Logistic Regression performs better than both K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier and Random Forest Classifier for this problem.
- Our model could finally achieved the accuracy level of <B>88.5%</B> with the current data set.
